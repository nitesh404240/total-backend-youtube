Controllers Folder Structure
The controllers folder usually contains multiple files, each responsible for handling different parts of your application. For example:

controllers/userController.js — Handles user-related actions (e.g., registration, login, profile update).

controllers/productController.js — Handles product-related actions (e.g., creating a product, listing products).

controllers/orderController.js — Handles order-related actions (e.g., placing an order, viewing orders).

controllers/authController.js — Handles authentication logic (e.g., login, logout).

So, the controllers/userController.js file would not be the only file. You would need other controllers depending on the features of your app.\
